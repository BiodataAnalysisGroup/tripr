The input for tripr is the ouput of the IMGT/HighV-QUEST analysis. The steps to 
get this data are the following:
-Register and enter to IMGT/HighV-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/home.action).
-Indicate the organism from which the sample derives (Homo sapiens in this case).
-Select the type of receptor studied (the options are IG, IGL, IGK, IGH, TR, TRA, TRB, TRG, and TRD).
-Upload the sequencing data as FASTA files.
-Start the analysis.
-Once the data is ready, download from the “Analysis history” tab. Each sample’s
    output consists of a folder with 10 files in txt format with immunogenetic 
    information. This folder is the input for the tripr analysis tool.
