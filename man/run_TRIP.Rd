\arguments{
\item{datapath}{(character) The directory where the folders of the data 
is located. Note that every sample of the dataset must have \strong{its 
own individual folder} and every sample folder must 
be in \strong{one root folder}. Note that \strong{every} file in the root 
folder will be used in the analysis. \cr
Supposedly the dataset is in user's \emph{Documents/} folder, one could use: 
\code{fs::path_home("Documents", "dataset")}, with the help of 
\link[fs]{path_home} function.
See the package vignette for more.}

\item{output_path}{(character) The directory where the output data will

\description{
\code{run_TRIP()} is a wrapper of \{tripr\} shiny analysis tool for use via R
 command line. 
Output of analysis is saved in \emph{tripr/extdata/output} folder, where R 
libraries are saved (typically \emph{R/library}).
